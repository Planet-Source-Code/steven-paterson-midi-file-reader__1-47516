### Description

This code is a re-write of the module "midi" in the PSC code entry "Advanced Midi Programming / Utility"

i was looking for a Midi file reader to read all the file's data in notes, control notations, and be able to extract comments in the files etc., i found this code that could do so but it was unreadeable (the code i used as a template to re-write was the original, which is in the project as ModOriginal) so i re-wrote it so other's could learn what i wanted to learn (unfortunately some of the byte translations are still in dutch, i couldn't translate Some of them, most are in english and the routines and helper routines are in english.)

EDIT: My Code is in ClsMidi, compare it with the code in ModOriginal to see it's advantages for learning!

Also thanks to peter wilson, i stole his space oddysey midi :p
